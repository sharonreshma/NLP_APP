# NLP (Natural Language Processing) Application

## Overview
This Streamlit-based application leverages spaCy, a leading NLP library, to perform advanced text processing tasks. Users can analyze text by tokenizing, visualizing part-of-speech tags, identifying named entities, and performing lemmatization.

## Features

### 1. Tokenization
- **Description**: Breaks down text into tokens, essential for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification.
- **Usage**: Enter text and click "Tokenize" to see the breakdown of words into tokens.

### 2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging Visualization
- **Description**: Visualizes each word with its associated part-of-speech tag (e.g., noun, verb, adjective), aiding in grammatical analysis and syntactic parsing.
- **Usage**: Enter text and explore the POS tags in a tabular format for detailed linguistic analysis.

### 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Description**: Automatically identifies and categorizes entities like persons, organizations, and locations in text, enhancing information extraction and data understanding.
- **Usage**: Input text and click "Recognize Entities" to visualize identified entities highlighted in context.

### 4. Lemmatization
- **Description**: Converts words into their base forms, crucial for text normalization and semantic analysis.
- **Usage**: Enter text to see lemmatized tokens, helping to standardize words for improved text processing.

## Outcome and Usage
- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights into text structure, entity extraction, and grammatical patterns for detailed data analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visual representations aid in understanding linguistic features and enhance data interpretation.

## Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Utilizes spaCy's efficient processing capabilities for fast and accurate text analysis.
- **User-Friendly**: Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for interactive text processing without needing complex setups.
- **Versatility**: Supports a wide range of NLP tasks from basic tokenization to advanced entity recognition and grammatical analysis.
